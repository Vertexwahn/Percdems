# Percdems

## Info

We were thinking about the perfect dependency management system ("Percdems"). 
There are many dependencies managers available for C\+\+ unfortunately, dependency management under C++ is terrible. 
We came up with an own solution called BlueGo. 
But we did not want to focus on building third-party libs. 
Because of this, we started with this repository to setup minimal build scripts for the different libraries we need.
